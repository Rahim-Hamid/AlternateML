# AlternateML
This project implements a multimodal machine learning system that generates original artwork titles for unseen images by conditioning a language model on visual features extracted from the image.

Given an input artwork image, the system produces a short, title-style text string without relying on retrieval or prompt templates.

Dataset used is the WikiArt Dataset from Kaggle - current model is trained on 8000 image-text relations - planning on scaling from 8000 to 30,000, with eventual plans to scale to 80,000 to encompass the entire dataset

Sample Generated Titles:
