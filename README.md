# AlternateML
This project implements a multimodal machine learning system that generates original artwork titles for unseen images by conditioning a language model on visual features extracted from the image.

Given an input artwork image, the system produces a short, title-style text string (e.g. “Muted Assembly”, “Figures at Dusk”) without relying on retrieval or prompt templates.

Sample Generated Titles:
